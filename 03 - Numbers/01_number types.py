# Python Numbers: 

'''
-> There are three numeric types in python:
    1. int
    2. float
    3. complex

'''
x = 1       # int
y = 2.9     # float
z = 1j      # complex
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)


# Int:
#  -> Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
a = 1
b = 3645432547467
c = -2918826
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))


# Float:
#  -> Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
m = 1.10
n = 1.0
p = -35.59
print(type(m))
print(type(n))
print(type(p))

#  -> Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
f = 35e3
g = 12E4
h = -87.7e100
print(type(f))
print(type(g))
print(type(h))


# Complex:
#  -> Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
c1 = 3+5j
c2 = 5j
c3 = -5j
print(type(c1))
print(type(c2))
print(type(c3))
